abstract = {The nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation (NLSE) is a seminal equation of nonlinear physics describing wave packet evolution in weakly-nonlinear dispersive media. The NLSE is especially important in understanding how high amplitude "rogue waves" emerge from noise through the process of modulation instability (MI) whereby a perturbation on an initial plane wave can evolve into strongly-localised "breather" or "soliton on finite background (SFB)" structures. Although there has been much study of such structures excited under controlled conditions, there remains the open question of how closely the analytic solutions of the NLSE actually model localised structures emerging in noise-seeded MI. We address this question here using numerical simulations to compare the properties of a large ensemble of emergent peaks in noise-seeded MI with the known analytic solutions of the NLSE. Our results show that both elementary breather and higher-order SFB structures are observed in chaotic MI, with the characteristics of the noise-induced peaks clustering closely around analytic NLSE predictions. A significant conclusion of our work is to suggest that the widely-held view that the Peregrine soliton forms a rogue wave prototype must be revisited. Rather, we confirm earlier suggestions that NLSE rogue waves are most appropriately identified as collisions between elementary SFB solutions.},

@article{Ashour2021,
abstract = {NonlinearSchrodinger.jl is a Julia package with a simple interface for studying solutions of nonlinear Schr$\backslash$"odinger equations (NLSEs). In approximately ten lines of code, one can perform a simulation of the cubic NLSE using one of 32 algorithms, including symplectic and Runge-Kutta-Nystr$\backslash$"om integrators up to eighth order. Furthermore, it is possible to compute analytical solutions via a numerical implementation of the Darboux transformation for extended NLSEs up to fifth order, with an equally simple interface. In what follows, we review the fundamentals of solving this class of equations numerically and analytically, discuss the implementation, and provide several examples.},

@article{Vinuesa2021,
abstract = {Machine learning is rapidly becoming a core technology for scientific computing, with numerous opportunities to advance the field of computational fluid dynamics. This paper highlights some of the areas of highest potential impact, including to accelerate direct numerical simulations, to improve turbulence closure modelling, and to develop enhanced reduced-order models. In each of these areas, it is possible to improve machine learning capabilities by incorporating physics into the process, and in turn, to improve the simulation of fluids to uncover new physical understanding. Despite the promise of machine learning described here, we also note that classical methods are often more efficient for many tasks. We also emphasize that in order to harness the full potential of machine learning to improve computational fluid dynamics, it is essential for the community to continue to establish benchmark systems and best practices for open-source software, data sharing, and reproducible research.},
