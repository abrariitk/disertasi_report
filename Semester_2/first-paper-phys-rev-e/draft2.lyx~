The success of machine learning especially deep learning have prompted a
 new interest in scientific community to apply the machine learning method
 to solve challenges in physical problems modeled by partial differential
 equations involving spatiotemporal variables.
 Depending on the approaches used, there are several perks including deep
 learning/data-driven approaches to physical problems which includes : (1)
 ability to incorporate measurement data in the model predictions

 proposed two stage physics informed neural network for solving integrable
 wave equations, in which the first stage construct a PINN as usual, and
 the second stage augment the integrability conditions and difference with
 first stage training result as additional constraint to the PINN loss function.
 Another variant of PINN was done by enforcing the

.
 The attractive feature of PINN is that the method is meshless, in other
 word, the training data from PINN is random sampled from an interval of
 space and time.
 Even though the PINN method might produce a nice generalization, the training
 process requires that the (sampled) breather should be enclosed in the
 training interval data.
 In a loose term, this mean that PINN is suitable for

dinger equations using reservoir computing.
 NLS is an ubiquitous equation in physics that models many phenomena likes
 optics, ocean waves with modulating amplitude, rogue waves etc.
 In particular, we would like to train the phenomena of the occurence of
 rogue waves modelled by the NLS equation.
 To the best of our knowledge, only

 which attempted to simulate NLS using Reservoir Computing, in which the
 authors simulated periodic Akhmadiev breather, Kutnezov-Ma solitons and
 second order periodic breather collision.
 The authors concluded that the second order breather collision is more
 unpredictable compared to the first order breather simulation.
 Our research is different by the fact that we use higher order breather
 as a training data (fifth order), and our training data is not only for
 one period, thus the RC has not yet encounter breather's peak.
 Furthermore, we employ parallel reservoir approach

The main principle in reservoir computing is the separation between internal
 states (reservoir) and the readout learning.
 As opposed to the backward propagation method which trains both the states
 and output parameters, the training in reservoir computing only applies
 to the readout.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The listening process correspond to constructing reservoir and evolve them
 based on input and previous states.
 The reservoir computing adopted was the non-leaky type given by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
r_{i} & =\tanh\left(\rho Wr_{i-1}+W_{in}u_{i-1}\right)\label{eq:Internal_State}\\
\hat{\psi}_{i} & =W_{out}\omega(r_{i})\label{eq:Readout}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$

 is an adjecency matrix which usually set to ensure

\end_inset

.
 This condition express that the effect of previous state and previous input
 at future state should vanish gradually at future time.
 The adjecency matrix is set to be sparsely connected and random to ensure
 that the reservoir is rich enough for learning phase.
 The input coupling matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{in}$
\end_inset

 is a sparse matrix whose entries magnitude not more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, the approximate number of non-zero element at each row is
 fixed.

During the prediction phase, the input vector

 in equation

 is replaced by the recent available prediction from the readout (equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Output"
plural "false"

\end_inset

) using the output matrix obtained during the training phase.
 However, as the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}^{(k)}$
\end_inset

 consist of overlapping domain, then the output should be constructed by
 combining information from the neighbouring reservoir 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}^{(k-1)},y_{i}^{(k)}y_{i}^{(k+1)}$
\end_inset

.
 Calling this prediction as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}_{i}^{(k)}$
\end_inset

, then the steps in prediction phase are: 
\end_layout

Compute

In this research, we follows the parallel RC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pathak2018"

\end_inset

, which split the spatial data into overlapping domains and train multiple
 reservoirs for each data chunk.
 The reasoning of splitting the data is that the exchange of information
 between two very far seperated spatial grid is not immediate, thus creating
 reservoir state modelling a connection between faraway points is not physical
 and also a waste of computation effort.

 Study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 examined different non-linear transformations for simulations of Lorenz-96
 system, which are inspired by the non-linearity present in the simulated
 equation.
 They conclude that the non-linear transformation enhance the predictive
 capability of the simulations, however they did not give conclusive result
 about which non-linearity transformation should be used, as all the transformat
ions give comparable result.
 Another experiment on the non-linearity effect was done in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 comparing several other non-linear transformation such as 2.2 and 1.8 power,
 tanh, exp and sin on the even elements.
 The numerical experiment on Lorenz-63 showed that square-even transformation
 had the best performance.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barbosa2021"

\end_inset

 showed that an improvement of the RC prediction can be achieved by respecting
 the symmetry of the equation present in the original system into the reservoir
 computing.
 As the NLS equation has an odd symmetry, the non-linear transformation
 that should be employed should preserve this symmetry.
 For that respect, we propose several alternatives non-linear transformation,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\omega}_{2}(r)=\left|r\right|r$
\end_inset

, the odd version of

In essential, the training can be done by using any method to solve linear
 least square problem.
 By defining the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}^{(k)}$

 as a matrix whose

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$

 respectively, then the training process is equivalent to solve the following
 matrix equation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^{T}+\beta\mathbf{I}\right)W_{out}^{T}=\mathbf{R}\mathbf{S}^{T}

As we would like to investigate the generalizability of the reservoir computing
 with different dynamics compared to training data, a robust cross validation
 is an essential step.
 The cross validation was run by using the recycled validation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Racca2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which deemed as robust and efficient as the training only once need to
 done for every hyperparameter.
 The recycled parameter trained the reservoir using the whole training set,
 and then run feedback/prediction mode on 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 slices of training data based on exact reservoir states at the beginning
 of each slice of cross validation set.

Simulation Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We trained a set of reservoirs to learn a simulation which governed by the
 NLS equation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\tau}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial\xi^{2}}+\left|\psi\right|^{2}\psi=0
\]

\end_inset

with the amplitude envelope 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\xi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 is a function of propagation distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and co-moving time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 A well known analytic solution of NLs is given by Akhmadiev breather given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi(\xi,t)=\left[1+\frac{2(1-2a)\cosh\left(\lambda t\right)+i\lambda\sinh\left(\lambda t\right)}{\sqrt{2a}\cos\left(\Omega x\right)-\cosh\left(\lambda t\right)}\right]e^{it}
\]

\end_inset

the behaviour of the solution is governed by a single parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in(0,0.5)$
\end_inset

, another parameters are related with 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, namely the fundamental wave number 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=2\sqrt{1-2a}$
\end_inset

 and growth factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\sqrt{8a(1-2a)}$
\end_inset

.
 Based on this fundamental solution, higher order maximal intensity breather
 can be constructed by choosing particular 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2},a_{3}\ldots,a_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that under particular phase and amplitude ,the breathers collides
 at particular time and position resulting at a higher peak with the procedure
 given by

 We simulated the construction of 5
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 order breather on a uniform background describing a highly non-linear situation.
 The objective of this simulation is to investigate under what conditions
 the Reservoir Computing can learn and simulate the maximum peak amplitude
 of a breather in NLS.
 For that purpose, we intentionally hide the peak of thr breather from the
 training data and preserve it as a part of test set.

 A brief explanation of the split-step method is given in Appendix.
 The initial condition was prepared according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 which generate the initial condition for maximum intensity soliton via
 Darboux Transformation.
 The modulation parameter used in generating the training set is 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=0.4802$
\end_inset

 in which there exists a unique maximum intensity soliton up to fifth order.
 The length of the spatial domain is one spatial period 
\begin_inset Formula $[-L/2,L/2]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $L=2\pi/\Omega$
\end_inset

 and 256 spatial nodes.
 The simulation was started from 
\begin_inset Formula $t=-2$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=5\cdot10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 and the peaks was achieved after , meaning there are 4000 time grids between
 the start of training data and the peak.

To quantify the error between predictions, a metric should be defined.
 For that purpose we define normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e(t)=\frac{\left\Vert \hat{\psi}(t)-\psi(t)\right\Vert }{\left\Vert \psi(t)\right\Vert }\label{eq:error}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Together with this norm, we also consider the prediction horizon defined
 as: 
\begin_inset Formula $PH(\varepsilon)=\min_{t}e(t)\geq\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, The prediction horizon is the first time the NRMSE exceed tolerance 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, in this study we consider case 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=0.4$

 which emphasize the symmetry between RC and the modelled system.
 The odd quadratic transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

 performed the best compared to the rest of transformation.
 The cubic transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{3}$
\end_inset

 as expected performed better than 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 which attributed to the odd symmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Despite the odd symmetry, the no transformation case perform poorly compared
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 However, we observe that by using more nodes, the case without non-linear
 transformation slightly better compared with
